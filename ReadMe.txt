Hello, This repository is to keep track of the practice problems from hacker ranks so I can refer back to them if desiered. 

  1.The files are named for the hierarchy the website uses for the practice.
  2. Each file is one problem and will have the problem commented out in the code along with the solution that worked. 
  
Have a great day.
